# web-security-week-9

## My Honeypots:
I deployed the Dionaea with http, p0f, and Shockpot Sinkhole honeypots. 
At the time of submission I had a total of 210 attacks- Dionaea: 144, p0f: 66, and Shickpot Sinkhole: 0.

## Issues Encountered:
The instructions on installation and configuration were unclear and inconsistent. I had to use a second walkthrough file alongside the codepath version. The assignment took close to 4 hours to complete. I feel with better guidance I could've done it in at least half the time.
I also had trouble downloading the json file, so I accessed it through the console and copy and pasted it into a text file.
